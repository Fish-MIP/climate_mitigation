Analyses to support FishMIP contribution to cross-sectoral climate mitigation paper


# Documentation

1. A. Original variable: unfished global marine animal biomass (wet weight) spanning size range 10g to 100kg, typical of the size range of exploitable fish. Units: g

B. Damage: delta (change) in unfished marine animal biomass in the size range above (g). Negative represents a decrease relative to the reference period; positive represents an increase.


2. A. Size classes. We have summed up biomass from sizes 10g to 100,000g (100kg) as these are representative of the majority of the range of exploitable marine fish biomass.

B. Values are versus mean annual value during reference period - see (4) below.

C. We do not provide T (temperature) values. Rationale for this is that we only have SST (sea-surface temperature) values, which are not typically used when discussing global land-based climate change (which refers to global atmospheric anomaly values). We can extract SST delta values if needed.


3. Differences vs. original paper: Difference from Tittensor et al. (2021) is that instead of total consumer biomass across 9 marine ecosystem models, we use total consumer biomass in the size bins above for a reduced set of models (6 models: APECOSM, BOATS, DBPM, EcoTROPH, Macroecological, ZooMS, as in Novaglio et al. subm.). Rationale is that these are the only models that can provide the size-structured outputs in a manner that is consistent with the original variable above. Tittensor et al. (2021) shows spatially explicit mean percentage changes; here we use summed global absolute values (g), excluding inland lakes.


4. Temperature anomaly reference period: 1995 - 2014.
